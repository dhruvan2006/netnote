**NetNote** is a distributed note-taking application designed to help you organize and access your notes seamlessly. Whether you want to manage your ideas, track tasks, or share information across devices, NetNote is here to make your note-taking experience efficient and intuitive.

## Getting Started

When you first launch NetNote, youâ€™ll need to create your **first collection**. A collection acts as a virtual folder where your notes are stored. To begin:

1. **Create Your First Collection**: On startup, select the dropdown saying "All notes" and click on "Add collection" to create a collection. Every note must belong to a collection, so this is the first step to start using NetNote.
2. **Add Notes**: Once you have a collection, you can start adding notes to it. Each note can include plain text or Markdown formatting for rich content like headings, lists, and links.

## Key Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write in Markdown and preview your formatted notes in real-time.
- **Multi-Collection Management**: Organize your notes across multiple collections for better categorization.
- **Embedded Files**: Add images and files directly into your notes.
- **Interconnected Notes**: Use tags and internal links to connect related notes.
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Sync changes automatically across all connected clients using WebSockets.
- **Live Language Switch**: Change the preferred language to one of: English, Dutch, Romanian, Polish
