# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- The agenda should be merged into the main branch before the meeting starts. This will give the team members, as well as the TA, time to prepare for the meeting.
- It is important that everyone is aware of the agenda and of the topics that will be discussed during the meeting. I felt like some team members were seeing the agenda for the first time during the meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: N/A


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- You need to take a bit more control into preventing the conversation from derailing. I remember during the meeting we sort of derailed a bit into talking about the ski trip.
- You did very well in leading the conversation though. Especially since the first meeting is always somewhat awkward, it was nice that you started the conversation using the agenda and to overall lead the conversation topics.
- Time on topics was good.
- Calling for the end of the meeting and summarizing what was discussed was very excellent.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Multiple people spoke up during the meeting when they had something to ask or to say.
- The atmosphere seemed very constructive and I felt like everyone felt comfortable speaking up and/or asking questions.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: N/A

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Planning for deadlines is overall good.
- Dividing the work into teams is a good idea, but make sure that everyone is aware of what the other team is doing. So make sure for future meetings you switch up the teams.
- Discussing the possible tasks for the next spring was a good idea.
